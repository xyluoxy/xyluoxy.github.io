Hi! I am Xiyu, a senior year CS undergraduate at <a href='https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/'>SUSTech</a>. I also exchanged at <a href='https://ucsd.edu/'>UC San Diego</a> in fall 2025.

### My research interests include:
- **Solutions for modality gap.** Evaluate and enhance the ability of interaction and alignment of visual and textual modalities, and gain inspirations from cognitive science while doing this. 
- **UniReps.** Unify vision-centered multimodal understanding and generation. Unify representations and frameworks. 
- **Embodied high level intelligence.** Develop multimodal models that support human-like perception, reasoning, memory, and affect-aware understanding in complex environments.

### News
- [2025-11] My first paper is accepted!
- [2025-9] A new quarter at UCSD begins!
- [2025-2] Collaboration with Oxford.
- [2024-7] Summer research at NUS.
